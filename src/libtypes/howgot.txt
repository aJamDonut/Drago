To get pixijs we used pixi-build-tools to parse each d.ts file into a JSON file, we then joined them together

To get eventemitter we downloaded it, changed the default export then used api-exporter to generate the json.

We merged all the json into one file like this

{
"data":[json1,json2,json3]
}
